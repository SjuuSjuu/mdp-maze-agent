# mdp-maze-agent
This repository contains an implementation of a simulation environment and agent control system using Markov Decision Processes (MDP) and Value Iteration. The project revolves around a maze-like environment where an agent interacts with the maze, makes decisions, and learns an optimal policy for navigating the maze.
